# Resolving Python for Data Visualization

This repository contains the exercises you'll work during the course "Resolving Python for Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn".

You may use the exercises to practice on your own free of charge; challenges and datasets are provided.

Within every folder, you will find 2 types of Jupyter Notebooks:

- A: Blank notebook to be completed with the explanations given in the [digital course](https://resolvingpython.gumroad.com/l/machine-learning).
- C: Blank notebook to be completed as a homework.
- B & D files are the solutions to the previous notebooks. If you want them, you need to buy the digital course.

If you want to showcase your work on this course as a portfolio, don't forget to [fork this repository](https://github.com/jsulopzs/course-resolving-python-data-visualization/fork) to create a copy on your profile.
